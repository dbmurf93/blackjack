# Blackjack

## Overview
This is a simplified version of the common card game. 

User Output goes to stdout, and the game monitors responses via cmdline. This will be replaced in future iterations with more user-friendly functionality


## Usage
To play blackjack use `go run .` from the root of the repository

## Logging
Currently testing out [slog](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/logging-in-go/#structured-logging-in-go-with-slog) sending logs to a `blackjack.log` logfile
